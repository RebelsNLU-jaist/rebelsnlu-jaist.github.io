# Step 1: Pass the smell-test

Interested in joining our lab? Thank you very much for your interest!

Since you are going to spend a long time with us, it is very important for you to make sure if you are comfortable working in our lab.
Here, the criteria of comfortableness varies: your research interest, lab environment, your expectation, working style, etc.
So I (very, very) strongly recommend you to make the best effort to probe our lab using the five senses!! (Otherwise, we both will be unhappy)
I offer several hints for this:

- Go through every pages of [our website](https://rebelsnlu-jaist.github.io/). Who is working, how many students do they have? How often do they publish papers, which area, which conference? What expertise do they have? Are they rich (research fundings)? Do they enjoy the research? You can learn lots of things through these web pages.
- Look at [the lab intro webpage at JAIST](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/laboratory/cs/inoue.html) (日本語版は[こちら](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/laboratory/cs/inoue.html)), where I describe basic skills I expect from you and general direction for supervision, let alone research direction.
- Chat with me (either online or offline is fine). During the meeting, we will be relaxed and informally discuss anything related to the lab (for example, about me, research topics, skills needed) possibly with coffee/tea.
Thourgh the conversation, you can probe our lab to see if you are a good fit. Feel free to [contact me via email](https://rebelsnlu-jaist.github.io/contact.html) (もちろん日本語でもOK！). 


# Step 2: Apply for the lab

Still interested in joining us after Step 1? Then apply for it! There are several ways to join us.


## For JAIST students

You can choose our lab in the 展開配属 (本配属) application form.
But, please note that the seats are limited: if there are many competitors, there is no 100% guarantee that you will be able to work with us because of the capacity.

## For non-JAIST students/社会人

[JAIST](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/) is a postgraduate university in Ishikawa, Japan.
JAIST has both master's program and doctoral program, and welcomes undergrad/grad students worldwide in Ishikawa campus and 社会人学生 in Tokyo satelite campus.

NOTE: I have bad news and good news.
The *bad news* is that if you are Ishikawa students accepted by regular examinations, then you are not 100% guraranteed to be able to work with the lab you want to work with after entering JAIST (as mentioned above).
It's so sad.
However, here is some *good news*.
There are multiple university schemes to avoid this.
For example, you can consider applying for "Examination for Admission on Recommendation for Overseas Residents" ([Master's](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/admissions/application-guide/guide-m.html) or [Doctoral](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/admissions/application-guide/guide-d.html)) or [配属研究室入学前内定制度](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/education/procedures/lab-assignment.html).
Please read carefully [these documents](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/admissions/) for more details about the admissions (日本語版は[こちら](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/education/procedures/)) and find out a suitable scheme for you.
