# Step 1: Talk to us

Interested in joining our lab? Thank you very much for your interest!

Since you are going to spend a long time with us, it is very important for you to make sure if you are comfortable working in our lab.
Here, the criteria of comfortableness varies: your research interest, lab environment, your expectation, working style, etc.

To figure it out, I offer two ways:

- Look at my [lab intro webpage at JAIST](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/laboratory/cs/inoue.html) (日本語版は[こちら](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/laboratory/cs/inoue.html)).
- Chat with me (either online or offline is fine). We will be relaxed and informally discuss anything related to the lab (for example, about me, research topics, skills needed) possibly with coffee/tea.
Thourgh the conversation, you can probe our lab to see if you are a good fit. Feel free to [contact me via email](https://rebelsnlu-jaist.github.io/contact.html) (もちろん日本語でもOK！). 


# Step 2: Apply for the lab

Still interested in joining us after Step 1? Then apply for it! There are several ways to join us.
