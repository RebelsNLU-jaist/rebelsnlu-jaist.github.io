Interested in joining our lab? Thanks so much for your interest!


# Step 1: Talk to us

It is very important to see if your working style matches our lab.
Currently, I'm hosting one-on-one free discussion hours, where we will be relaxed and informally discuss anything related to the lab (for example, about me, research topics, skills needed, etc.) possibly with coffee/tea.
Either online or offline is fine.
Feel free to [contact me via email](https://rebelsnlu-jaist.github.io/contact.html).


# Step 2: Apply for the lab

If you really think that you want to work with us after the talk session, apply for it! There are several ways to work with us.


## For JAIST students

You can choose our lab in the 展開配属 (本配属) application form.
But, please note that the seats are limited: if there are many competitors, there is no 100% guarantee that you will be assigned to our lab by university regulation.

## For non-JAIST students

See [here](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/admissions/) for admission.
More information will be available soon.
